# OpenMUN
This is a FOSS java program designed to help conferences with Model UN!
Todo:
    1. Make an area for the DIAS to put every delegation present (or present and voting)
    2. Moderated Caucus area that includes a timer for length and a timer for speaking time
    and a list of everyone who has spoken
    3. Unmoderated Caucus area with a timer
    4. Voting procedure (Maybe something for resolutions idk how that would work though)
